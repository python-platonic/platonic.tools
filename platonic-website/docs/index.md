Data structures for Clean Architecture applications in Python.

* Represent various backends — say, Redis, S3 or Kafka — as simple and typed datastructures similar to iterators, lists, and dicts from the standard library;
* Write code in terms of high level abstractions;
* Port code from one backend to another;
* Maintain static typing correctness.
