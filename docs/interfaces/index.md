Interfaces are fa√ßades which hide intricacies and ugly parts of various backends, providing you with a clean and unified interface to rule them all. For example, if you have `Queue` implementations for AWS SQS, Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ, you may build a task queue on whichever one of them you choose - and your client code will not change too much when you switch from one to another. 

## Available interfaces
